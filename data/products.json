Unlike the other pieces in the collection, which are based on flat modular elements, the lounger appears as a single block. Two easy-to-manufacture sides are cut out of a single piece of 8mm plywood in an organic shape and joined by struts. A canvas is stretched over the construction to form a casing inspired by lightweight and stable constructions used in aeronautics.

Designed in 1953, this lounger documents the early and experimental phase in their work, during which they also designed a collection of furniture conceived for production by the local manufacturer Sim. Unlike the other pieces in the collection, which are based on flat modular elements, the lounger appears as a single block. Two easy-to-manufacture sides are cut out of a single piece of 8mm plywood in an organic shape and joined by struts. A canvas is stretched over the construction to form a casing inspired by lightweight and stable constructions used in aeronautics.

The woven cane seat gives the chair a light, transparent appearance.<br><br>The Round Chair, which was serially produced in the workshops of the cabinetmaker Johannes Hansen and which for many represented the perfect wooden chair, marked Wegner’s international breakthrough. Dubbed ‘The Chair’ in the 1950 February issue of the American magazine *Interiors*, it soon became the symbol of the Danish 1950s variant of post-war organic modernism known as Danish Modern or Danish Design.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Designmuseum Denmark, Inv.

Venturi’s most famous furniture design consists of a series of nine chairs, which he designed for Knoll International between 1979 and 1984. By means of clichéd simplification, his chairs cite models from United States’ and European furniture history, ranging from the eighteenth century Queen Anne style to Art Deco of the thirties. Venturi was interested in the image, the representative side, of these models.

Venturi’s most famous furniture design consists of a series of nine chairs, which he designed for Knoll International between 1979 and 1984. By means of clichéd simplification, his chairs cite models from United States’ and European furniture history, ranging from the eighteenth century Queen Anne style to Art Deco of the thirties. Venturi was interested in the image, the representative side, of these models.

Especially interesting is the similarity between Machoň’s design and the lounge chairs designed by Josef Chochol for the interior of the English Club in Prague in 1911. In their furniture designs, both Machoň and Chochol sought to translate the Cubist idiom developed by Paris-based painters into three-dimensional functional objects. Their designs rest on geometric forms and on solid volumes. Their departure from the standard chair made up of legs, seat, backrest, and armrests resulted in creations that seem to emphasize their own monumentality. This in turn may lead one to overlook the fact that both models, as avant-garde as they may appear, were in fact produced using traditional methods and materials.<br><br>After Czechoslovakia gained independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Machoň adopted a style that rested less on volume than on the amalgamation of standard set pieces of the Czech building tradition.<br><br>Text: Donatella Cacciola<br>" },

Since scarcity of resources and rationing made furniture production problematic during the war, Knoll covered this chair with nylon extracted from surplus army equipment.

The first version of the chair went on show at the exhibition *Wie Wohnen?* in 1949/50 in Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. Eiermann had designed a four-room apartment for a family of five especially for the exhibition. Its multipurpose room contained a dining area and a seating area, where the wicker chair stood. The E 10 was first made by basket-maker Friedrich Herr of Karlsruhe. Its load-bearing pedestal consists of a cane work cylinder with an inside frame made of rattan for extra sturdiness.

The first version of the chair went on show at the exhibition *Wie Wohnen?* in 1949/50 in Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. Eiermann had designed a four-room apartment for a family of five especially for the exhibition. Its multipurpose room contained a dining area and a seating area, where the wicker chair stood.

It is an adaptation of a model used in the nineteenth century by British colonial officials during their work-related travels, which Kienzle had seen in London in 1928. Its advantages are that it is lightweight and takes up little space. The chair’s legs are connected by round bars, which are inserted into the open seam of the seat cover (in copies with the original cover). Similarly, the cover is affixed to the movable backrest, which is attached to the upper ends of the back legs with a pivot pin. The leather strap armrests are fastened to the legs with brass buttons.

It is an adaptation of a model used in the nineteenth century by British colonial officials during their work-related travels, which Kienzle had seen in London in 1928. Its advantages are that it is lightweight and takes up little space. The chair’s legs are connected by round bars, which are inserted into the open seam of the seat cover (in copies with the original cover). Similarly, the cover is affixed to the movable backrest, which is attached to the upper ends of the back legs with a pivot pin. The leather strap armrests are fastened to the legs with brass buttons.

However, to assure comfort, a cushion was offered separately. In the years to follow, further extras were added such as armrests (1941) and a reading table, in 1944 a version of the lounger with wheels was launched. In 1936, Swedish architect Uno Åhrén remarked on the lounger’s simplicity in construction, comfort, and affordability. ‘There is nothing extraordinary, and that is what makes it good.’<sup>2</sup> This modest, yet ambitious and sophisticated approach is typical for modern Scandinavian design to which Mathsson made a significant contribution.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Widman, ‘Bruno Mathsson möbelskaparen och människan’ (2006), 17; cf.

Frankl recalls the skyscrapers that started shooting up in New York City and Chicago in the late nineteenth century and symbolized America’s economic prosperity.<br><br>This bookshelf did not start life on the drawing board but was rather a product of chance. Frankl himself explained how he had wanted a place to store books of different sizes. This led him to take ordinary boards and join them to form boxes of various shapes and sizes in which books and other objects could be either stored or displayed.<sup>1</sup> The boxes were then stacked in order of size. When neighbours told him that his bookshelf looked like a skyscraper, Frankl realized that this would make an ideal selling point. He turned the bookshelf into a series comprising desks, occasional tables, and chairs. The designs soon proved very popular among a more affluent clientele.<sup>2</sup><br><br>At the time, the US furniture market was still dominated by European-inspired forms and styles while lacking the quintessentially American. Frankl was one of the first to close this gap by taking the skyscraper as a symbol of modern America and turning it into an entire genre, the Skyscraper Style. According to Frankl, the straight lines evoke speed and simplicity; after all, a straight line is always the most direct and hence the fastest connection between any two given points.

Frankl | The floor-to-ceiling Skyscraper Furniture by Paul T. Frankl recalls the skyscrapers that started shooting up in New York City and Chicago in the late nineteenth century and symbolized America’s economic prosperity.<br><br>This bookshelf did not start life on the drawing board but was rather a product of chance. Frankl himself explained how he had wanted a place to store books of different sizes. This led him to take ordinary boards and join them to form boxes of various shapes and sizes in which books and other objects could be either stored or displayed.<sup>1</sup> The boxes were then stacked in order of size. When neighbours told him that his bookshelf looked like a skyscraper, Frankl realized that this would make an ideal selling point. He turned the bookshelf into a series comprising desks, occasional tables, and chairs. The designs soon proved very popular among a more affluent clientele.<sup>2</sup><br><br>At the time, the US furniture market was still dominated by European-inspired forms and styles while lacking the quintessentially American. Frankl was one of the first to close this gap by taking the skyscraper as a symbol of modern America and turning it into an entire genre, the Skyscraper Style. According to Frankl, the straight lines evoke speed and simplicity; after all, a straight line is always the most direct and hence the fastest connection between any two given points. A sense of speed and simplicity, he argued, informed the American way of life and should therefore inform its domestic interiors, too.<sup>3</sup><br><br><sup>1</sup> Johnson, ‘The New Furniture Gives Every One His Own Skyline’ (2007), 66.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Cf.

He and his sons produced three more examples in 1960.<sup>2</sup> The design was never put into serial production, but more than ever speaks to the imagination, probably because the form dovetails well with the sculptural furniture realized in recent decades, including designs by Marc Newson and Ron Arad.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Fragments from a filmed interview of Piet van Moock with Gerrit Rietveld in 1963, Onrust, *De weelde van de soberheid*, 1991.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Driessen, *Important 20th Century Design*, lot no. 80.<br><br>Text: Ida van Zijl<br>" },

He was asked to ‘come east and work on any designs or sculpture he wished.’<sup>1</sup> In 1950, Bertoia moved to Pennsylvania with his family and commenced work on sculptures and furniture. Over the course of the design process he experimented with mesh structures and produced numerous sketches and models. Finally, a protruding bowl-shaped structure emerged from the wire, giving the impression of a square wire mesh that had been deformed three-dimensionally under the weight of a seated person, thereby pulling it into the diamond shape that gives the chair its name.<br><br>In December 1952, the chair was part of a whole series of wire seating which was presented for the first time, along with Bertoia’s metal sculptures, in the New York showroom of Knoll Associates.

He was asked to ‘come east and work on any designs or sculpture he wished.’<sup>1</sup> In 1950, Bertoia moved to Pennsylvania with his family and commenced work on sculptures and furniture. Over the course of the design process he experimented with mesh structures and produced numerous sketches and models. Finally, a protruding bowl-shaped structure emerged from the wire, giving the impression of a square wire mesh that had been deformed three-dimensionally under the weight of a seated person, thereby pulling it into the diamond shape that gives the chair its name.<br><br>In December 1952, the chair was part of a whole series of wire seating which was presented for the first time, along with Bertoia’s metal sculptures, in the New York showroom of Knoll Associates.
