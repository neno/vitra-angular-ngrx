Knoll, born into a German furniture manufacturing family, founded his eponymous company in New York City in 1938, the same year that he emigrated to the United States. Originally, Knoll had planned to import European furniture, but the outbreak of World War II forced Knoll to change his plans. Starting in 1941, he collaborated with Jens Risom, producing Risom’s simple, modern furniture designs in wood. That same year, Knoll also began to work with Florence Schust, who took over as director of Knoll’s planning department in 1943. In 1946, Florence Schust and Hans Knoll married. In that same year, the company was renamed Knoll Associates and in 1968 it changed its name again to Knoll International. Thanks to Florence Knoll, who had worked for a time with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge and had studied and become friends with Mies van der Rohe, the firm gained the exclusive right to reissue Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Chair as early as 1948. In the years that followed, the firm also produced the work of many other well-known designers, including Harry Bertoia, Isamu Noguchi, George Nakashima, and Eero Saarinen. Saarinen’s Tulip series (1955–57) became the most famous Knoll furniture line. Both with this portfolio and with Florence Knoll’s many own designs, the firm influenced the International Style in the post-war period with its furnishings for offices and private homes. After Hans Knoll’s death in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as director of the company. The firm strengthened its ties with European designers and dealers, such as Wohnbedarf in Switzerland. This led to Knoll’s production of designs by Ilmari Tapiovaara and Hans Bellmann. Herbert Matter designed Knoll’s advertising. When Florence Knoll retired in 1965, Robert Cadwallader took over the company’s management. In 1968, Knoll acquired the Italian company Gavina, and with it the manufacturing rights for important designs by Marcel Breuer. The firm also collaborated with numerous female Italian designers during this period, including Cini Boeri and Gae Aulenti. In 1968 Massimo Vignelli designed a new corporate identity for the firm which is still used today. In the 1970s, the company added models by designers from the United States, including Charles Pollock, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, and later Frank O. Gehry. The Musée des Arts décoratifs in Paris dedicated an exhibition to the firm in 1972, *Knoll au Louvre*. The company has changed hands several times in recent decades and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. In addition to home furnishings, Knoll concentrates on the production of office furnishings and textiles. In 1997, Knoll opened a company museum at its headquarters in East Greenville, Pennsylvania.<br><br>‘Knoll – Im Haut- und Knochen-Stil’, *Der Spiegel*, 16, 1960, 64–75.<br>Knoll [website] &lt;http://www.knoll.com&gt; accessed 17.11.2014.<br>Lutz, Brian, *Knoll: A Modernist Universe* (New York: Rizzoli, 2010).<br>Rouland, Steven and Linda Rouland, *Knoll Furniture: 1938–1960* (Atglen: Schiffer Publishing, 1999).<br>", "PerFullText" : "SO+SD | Produzent | Knoll Associates | Knoll Associates | United States | New York | United States | Knoll Associates | Hans G.

Saarinen’s Tulip series (1955–57) became the most famous Knoll furniture line. Both with this portfolio and with Florence Knoll’s many own designs, the firm influenced the International Style in the post-war period with its furnishings for offices and private homes. After Hans Knoll’s death in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as director of the company. The firm strengthened its ties with European designers and dealers, such as Wohnbedarf in Switzerland. This led to Knoll’s production of designs by Ilmari Tapiovaara and Hans Bellmann. Herbert Matter designed Knoll’s advertising. When Florence Knoll retired in 1965, Robert Cadwallader took over the company’s management. In 1968, Knoll acquired the Italian company Gavina, and with it the manufacturing rights for important designs by Marcel Breuer. The firm also collaborated with numerous female Italian designers during this period, including Cini Boeri and Gae Aulenti. In 1968 Massimo Vignelli designed a new corporate identity for the firm which is still used today. In the 1970s, the company added models by designers from the United States, including Charles Pollock, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, and later Frank O. Gehry. The Musée des Arts décoratifs in Paris dedicated an exhibition to the firm in 1972, *Knoll au Louvre*. The company has changed hands several times in recent decades and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. In addition to home furnishings, Knoll concentrates on the production of office furnishings and textiles. In 1997, Knoll opened a company museum at its headquarters in East Greenville, Pennsylvania.<br><br>‘Knoll – Im Haut- und Knochen-Stil’, *Der Spiegel*, 16, 1960, 64–75.<br>Knoll [website] &lt;http://www.knoll.com&gt; accessed 17.11.2014.<br>Lutz, Brian, *Knoll: A Modernist Universe* (New York: Rizzoli, 2010).<br>Rouland, Steven and Linda Rouland, *Knoll Furniture: 1938–1960* (Atglen: Schiffer Publishing, 1999).<br>" },

Shortly after the licence agreement was finalised in 1957, Fehlbaum began producing the Herman Miller Collection, which also included designs by George Nelson along with the Eames’ furniture. In the years that followed, the pieces were distributed under various company names: in Switzerland first by Contura S.A., later by the Basel-based Herman Miller AG, and in Germany by Fehlbaum GmbH.

In 1915, he modernized the manufacturing process, making it possible to produce furniture in larger quantities. Important clients, such as the Christiansborg Palace and the Copenhagen University library, boosted the firm’s reputation. In 1932, Poul Fritz Hansen and Søren Hansen entered the business, marking the third generation of management by the Hansen family.

In the 1930s, the company temporarily held the manufacturing rights for Thonet furniture and manufactured tubular steel furniture. Among the well-known designers of this time were Kaare Klint, Mogens Lassen, and Fritz Schlegel; in 1933, Arne Jacobsen designed his first chair for Fritz Hansen. By the mid-1940s, the company began collaborating with designers Hans J. Wegner and Børge Mogensen.

that Michael Thonet founded in 1819 in Boppard am Rhein, Germany. Aside from producing Biedermeier furniture designs, he developed a procedure for bending laminated wood. Since Thonet had heavy debts in Boppard, he moved in 1842 to Vienna, where he began working for the furniture company Carl Leistler & Sohn. In 1849, Thonet and his sons started their own company in Vienna. In 1850, their workshop produced a new kind of chair for the Viennese coffee house Daum, which was lightweight and therefore economical. It was later known as the model No. 4. In 1851, the firm presented its furniture to an international audience at the World’s Fair in London. In 1853, Michael Thonet handed the reins of the company to his sons, who continued production under the name Gebrüder Thonet. In order to protect itself from imitators, the firm patented its procedure for bending solid wood in 1856. Furniture production was gradually switched to this new procedure over the following years. In 1857 Gebrüder Thonet created their first furniture factory, in Koritschan, Moravia (now Koryčany, Czech Republic). By 1880 they had established five additional factories in Eastern Europe. The business was internationalized, with branches worldwide. In 1859, the firm brought out its No. 14 chair, which could be dismantled for transport. It became Thonet’s most successful furniture design. The first German branch was opened in Frankenberg an der Eder in 1889. By 1900 the firm had more than fifty production plants. At this time, Thonet also began working on new chair designs with architects such as Otto Wagner and Otto Prutscher. Numerous designs by Adolf Loos and Josef Hoffmann were added to the range, thanks to the 1922 merger with Mundus, which had created the firm Thonet-Mundus – the world’s largest furniture manufacturer. Starting in 1928, Gebrüder Thonet began buying manufacturing rights for tubular steel furniture and taking over smaller manufacturers of such furniture. Thus, the firm obtained the rights to the designs of Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, Anton Lorenz, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Mart Stam, among others. Thonet-Mundus was dissolved as an international network of companies and brands in the late 1930s. During World War II, many factories were destroyed and the Eastern European branches were expropriated. The Czech branch was turned into the Ton brand in 1948; the former Austrian brand Gebrüder Thonet Vienna was renamed Wiener GTV Design in 2013 and is now based in Torino, Italy. Georg Thonet reopened his German plant in Frankenberg in 1945 and resumed production of wood and tubular steel furniture, including designs by Eddie Harlis and Verner Panton.

This cooperation resulted in the birth of Arflex, based in Milan, Italy, in 1950. Zanuso used these materials for lounge chair and sofa upholstery, and brought an early success to the company in 1951 with his presentation of the Lady chair at the IX Triennale di Milano. In addition to its first furniture models, from 1951 and 1954 the company manufactured improved comfort car seats that could be fitted in the Fiat 500 instead of standard cushion variants. In the decades that followed, technical innovations continued to drive the production of multifunctional furniture such as Joe Colombo’s Personal Container (1964) and several designs for seating furniture by the likes of Franco Albini, Cini Boeri, and the Studio BBPR.

This cooperation resulted in the birth of Arflex, based in Milan, Italy, in 1950. Zanuso used these materials for lounge chair and sofa upholstery, and brought an early success to the company in 1951 with his presentation of the Lady chair at the IX Triennale di Milano. In addition to its first furniture models, from 1951 and 1954 the company manufactured improved comfort car seats that could be fitted in the Fiat 500 instead of standard cushion variants. In the decades that followed, technical innovations continued to drive the production of multifunctional furniture such as Joe Colombo’s Personal Container (1964) and several designs for seating furniture by the likes of Franco Albini, Cini Boeri, and the Studio BBPR.

After the merger with the Münchner Werkstätten für Wohnungseinrichtung, Karl Bertsch, in 1907 the two companies began trading under the shared name Deutsche Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst, Dresden und München.

It was renamed Embru-Werke in 1912. It emerged from the firm Herrmann Hess Vontobel and at first continued to manufacture iron bed frames and steel spring mattresses. In 1928, it was instrumental in the birth of modern design, co-developing or turning out new wood, steel, and aluminium furniture. As of 1931, Embru produced modern tubular steel and aluminium furniture exclusively for the Zurich-based company Wohnbedarf and it maintained close contact with that firm’s co-founder, Sigfried Giedion.

It was renamed Embru-Werke in 1912. It emerged from the firm Herrmann Hess Vontobel and at first continued to manufacture iron bed frames and steel spring mattresses. In 1928, it was instrumental in the birth of modern design, co-developing or turning out new wood, steel, and aluminium furniture. As of 1931, Embru produced modern tubular steel and aluminium furniture exclusively for the Zurich-based company Wohnbedarf and it maintained close contact with that firm’s co-founder, Sigfried Giedion.

The company was contracted by the US Army to produce three-dimensional, moulded plywood leg splints for war invalids. Evans took over the company, renamed it the Molded Plywood Division and placed Eames at the helm of research and development. The subcontractor in Venice started production of splints and stretchers and conducted intensive research into the use of moulded plywood parts in aircraft construction. Before the end of World War II, the group associated with Eames also began to develop furniture and children’s toys made of moulded plywood, which were briefly produced starting in 1945 in Venice, and distributed by Herman Miller. Production ceased in 1947 and the Eames Office moved into the former production facilities in Venice. After Edward S. Evans’ death, his sons continued running Evans Products, producing both plywood construction components and plywood chairs in the 1950s.

In 1943, a portentous meeting took place between Charles Eames and Edward S. Evans: Eames was in search of financing for the Plyformed Wood Company, which he had founded in 1942 with John Entenza, Harry Bertoia, Gregory Ain, and others in Venice, Los Angeles. The company was contracted by the US Army to produce three-dimensional, moulded plywood leg splints for war invalids. Evans took over the company, renamed it the Molded Plywood Division and placed Eames at the helm of research and development. The subcontractor in Venice started production of splints and stretchers and conducted intensive research into the use of moulded plywood parts in aircraft construction. Before the end of World War II, the group associated with Eames also began to develop furniture and children’s toys made of moulded plywood, which were briefly produced starting in 1945 in Venice, and distributed by Herman Miller. Production ceased in 1947 and the Eames Office moved into the former production facilities in Venice. After Edward S. Evans’ death, his sons continued running Evans Products, producing both plywood construction components and plywood chairs in the 1950s. In the spring of 1962, the main production facility in Coos Bay, Oregon, closed its doors forever. In a tribute to the founder, a nearby section of Highway 101 was named Evans Boulevard.<br><br>Beebe, Sandra, *The Company by the Bay: A Portrait of Edward S.

From around 1900, then-director Joseph de Leeuw transformed Metz & Co. into an exclusive department store for fashion and interior design. It sold such items as glass and porcelain ware, some of which were manufactured abroad, and produced and sold handcrafted furniture. In 1913 Metz opened its first branch in The Hague. After World War I the company hired Paul Bromberg as head of the furniture department; he was succeeded by Willem Penaat. In 1930, the company began to work with Gerrit Rietveld, who erected a glass exhibition pavilion on the department store’s roof. Later, Rietveld designed additional retail shops for Metz. The company was the first to mass-produce Rietveld’s furniture designs, making them available to a growing circle of customers into the 1950s. The company produced its own wooden furniture, such as the Zig-Zag Chair, whereas the production of tubular steel chairs and lounge chairs was outsourced.

USA, with the aim of producing historicist furniture. In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree joined the company, becoming its director ten years later. For a time, the firm operated under the name Michigan Star Furniture Company. In 1923, De Pree took over the company with help from his father-in-law, after whom he re-named the firm the Herman Miller Furniture Company. Until 1932, the company produced conventional wooden furniture. When Gilbert Rhode became head designer, he worked to modernize the company’s designs. In 1933, Herman Miller presented its first modern collection; by 1936, traditional pieces disappeared from the catalogue. After Rhode’s death in 1945, George Nelson took over his position and brought renowned, innovative designers to work at Herman Miller, including Charles and Ray Eames, Alexander Girard, Isamu Noguchi, and others. Nelson and his New York office also produced their own key designs. Ultimately, Herman Miller became one of the most important American manufacturers of modern furniture for homes and offices. In 1948, the firm earned accolades for its Eames models of moulded plywood and fibreglass-reinforced plastic. In 1957, Herman Miller assigned the Swiss company Vitra the manufacturing licenses for the European market. Three years later, in 1960, the firm removed ‘Furniture Company’ from its name; it also made the Herman Miller Research Division in Ann Arbor, Michigan, largely independent. With the introduction of the Action Office, designed by Robert Probst and George Nelson, Herman Miller set a new standard for office furniture and reaffirmed its role as one of the most important manufacturers in this market. In 1962 Hugh De Pree succeeded his father as the company head. By the mid-1960s, the company had more than 150 sales offices spanning several continents.

In the early 1960s the company produced Gae Aulenti’s Sgarsul rocking chair (1962) and the Saratoga furniture series (1964/70) designed by Massimo and Lella Vignelli. Toward the end of the 1960s Poltronova began to cooperate with representatives of Radical Design, manufacturing such objects as Archizoom’s sofas Superonda (1966) and Safari (1967), and the Mies lounge chair (1969). Domestic furniture and lighting objects by Superstudio were included in the range of offerings. The company received accolades for its Joe lounge chair, created in 1970 in cooperation with Jonathan De Pas, Donato D’Urbino, and Paolo Lomazzi.

Sottsass’ designs for Poltronova became increasingly experimental. Although the Loto table (1963) and the Califfo sofa (1964) only gradually influenced 1960s home decor conventions, Sottsass’ furniture series Mobili Grigi (1970) – freed from conventional forms and functions – became a metaphysical statement, a sculpture that was, at first, barely possible to sell. In the early 1960s the company produced Gae Aulenti’s Sgarsul rocking chair (1962) and the Saratoga furniture series (1964/70) designed by Massimo and Lella Vignelli. Toward the end of the 1960s Poltronova began to cooperate with representatives of Radical Design, manufacturing such objects as Archizoom’s sofas Superonda (1966) and Safari (1967), and the Mies lounge chair (1969). Domestic furniture and lighting objects by Superstudio were included in the range of offerings.

Ponti delivered designs for the first-class salon of the luxury liner *Andrea Doria*, which were then executed by Cassina. Together with Ponti, Cassina subsequently developed various chairs, including the Superleggera, which brought international recognition to the firm.

Though broad in scope, this initial field of activity was squarely based on a thorough knowledge of woodworking. After World War I, the firm began to work together with architects like Giovanni Muzio or Gio Ponti, who contracted Bernini to produce handcrafted construction elements and exclusive custom-made products. To handle these orders, a workshop was opened in Milan. In the late 1950s Bernini began to mass-produce furniture and was licensed to manufacture products such as Herman Miller’s Eames designs for De Padova. The collaboration with Gianfranco Frattini generated Bernini’s first own furniture collection (1960), which included tables, chairs, and bookshelves, and created a link between traditional typologies and modern forms. Even before its relocation in 1965 to Carate Brianza, Italy, Bernini had begun to expand its range of innovative plastic furniture. One of the first designs in this category was the lounge chair Nastro CL9 by Cesare Leonardi and Franca Stagi (1961).

Though broad in scope, this initial field of activity was squarely based on a thorough knowledge of woodworking. After World War I, the firm began to work together with architects like Giovanni Muzio or Gio Ponti, who contracted Bernini to produce handcrafted construction elements and exclusive custom-made products. To handle these orders, a workshop was opened in Milan. In the late 1950s Bernini began to mass-produce furniture and was licensed to manufacture products such as Herman Miller’s Eames designs for De Padova. The collaboration with Gianfranco Frattini generated Bernini’s first own furniture collection (1960), which included tables, chairs, and bookshelves, and created a link between traditional typologies and modern forms. Even before its relocation in 1965 to Carate Brianza, Italy, Bernini had begun to expand its range of innovative plastic furniture. One of the first designs in this category was the lounge chair Nastro CL9 by Cesare Leonardi and Franca Stagi (1961).

Aside from producing Biedermeier furniture designs, he developed a procedure for bending laminated wood.

In 1849, Thonet and his sons started their own company in Vienna. In 1850, their workshop produced a new kind of chair for the Viennese coffee house Daum, which was lightweight and therefore economical. It was later known as the model No. 4. In 1851, the firm presented its furniture to an international audience at the World’s Fair in London. In 1853, Michael Thonet handed the reins of the company to his sons, who continued production under the name Gebrüder Thonet. In order to protect itself from imitators, the firm patented its procedure for bending solid wood in 1856. Furniture production was gradually switched to this new procedure over the following years. In 1857 Gebrüder Thonet created their first furniture factory, in Koritschan, Moravia (now Koryčany, Czech Republic). By 1880 they had established five additional factories in Eastern Europe. The business was internationalized, with branches worldwide. In 1859, the firm brought out its No. 14 chair, which could be dismantled for transport. It became Thonet’s most successful furniture design. The first German branch was opened in Frankenberg an der Eder in 1889. By 1900 the firm had more than fifty production plants. At this time, Thonet also began working on new chair designs with architects such as Otto Wagner and Otto Prutscher. Numerous designs by Adolf Loos and Josef Hoffmann were added to the range, thanks to the 1922 merger with Mundus, which had created the firm Thonet-Mundus – the world’s largest furniture manufacturer. Starting in 1928, Gebrüder Thonet began buying manufacturing rights for tubular steel furniture and taking over smaller manufacturers of such furniture. Thus, the firm obtained the rights to the designs of Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, Anton Lorenz, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Mart Stam, among others. Thonet-Mundus was dissolved as an international network of companies and brands in the late 1930s. During World War II, many factories were destroyed and the Eastern European branches were expropriated.

Knoll, born into a German furniture manufacturing family, founded his eponymous company in New York City in 1938, the same year that he emigrated to the United States. Originally, Knoll had planned to import European furniture, but the outbreak of World War II forced Knoll to change his plans. Starting in 1941, he collaborated with Jens Risom, producing Risom’s simple, modern furniture designs in wood. That same year, Knoll also began to work with Florence Schust, who took over as director of Knoll’s planning department in 1943. In 1946, Florence Schust and Hans Knoll married. In that same year, the company was renamed Knoll Associates and in 1968 it changed its name again to Knoll International. Thanks to Florence Knoll, who had worked for a time with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge and had studied and become friends with Mies van der Rohe, the firm gained the exclusive right to reissue Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Chair as early as 1948. In the years that followed, the firm also produced the work of many other well-known designers, including Harry Bertoia, Isamu Noguchi, George Nakashima, and Eero Saarinen. Saarinen’s Tulip series (1955–57) became the most famous Knoll furniture line. Both with this portfolio and with Florence Knoll’s many own designs, the firm influenced the International Style in the post-war period with its furnishings for offices and private homes. After Hans Knoll’s death in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as director of the company. The firm strengthened its ties with European designers and dealers, such as Wohnbedarf in Switzerland. This led to Knoll’s production of designs by Ilmari Tapiovaara and Hans Bellmann. Herbert Matter designed Knoll’s advertising. When Florence Knoll retired in 1965, Robert Cadwallader took over the company’s management. In 1968, Knoll acquired the Italian company Gavina, and with it the manufacturing rights for important designs by Marcel Breuer. The firm also collaborated with numerous female Italian designers during this period, including Cini Boeri and Gae Aulenti. In 1968 Massimo Vignelli designed a new corporate identity for the firm which is still used today. In the 1970s, the company added models by designers from the United States, including Charles Pollock, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, and later Frank O. Gehry. The Musée des Arts décoratifs in Paris dedicated an exhibition to the firm in 1972, *Knoll au Louvre*. The company has changed hands several times in recent decades and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. In addition to home furnishings, Knoll concentrates on the production of office furnishings and textiles.
