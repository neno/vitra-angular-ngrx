Axel Bruchhäuser established ties with such living proponents of Modernism as Mart Stam, Marcel Breuer, and Heinz Rasch. This gave rise to a collection with historical prototypes and designs, as well as to the reissues or the first production of selected designs by Breuer, Walter Gropius, Peter Keler, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in cooperation with the Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin and with the designers themselves or their heirs. The Bruchhäusers also worked with Jean Prouvé and produced his furniture designs – sometimes modified – until 2001, when Vitra received the manufacturing rights from Prouvé’s heirs. Alongside the classical collection, Tecta also developed new furniture designs with designers such as Stefan Wewerka and Alison and Peter Smithson. Axel Bruchhäuser opened his chair museum, Burg Beverungen (today the Kragstuhlmuseum) in 1979, which moved to the production site in a new building designed by Peter Smithson in 2003.

Axel Bruchhäuser established ties with such living proponents of Modernism as Mart Stam, Marcel Breuer, and Heinz Rasch. This gave rise to a collection with historical prototypes and designs, as well as to the reissues or the first production of selected designs by Breuer, Walter Gropius, Peter Keler, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in cooperation with the Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin and with the designers themselves or their heirs. The Bruchhäusers also worked with Jean Prouvé and produced his furniture designs – sometimes modified – until 2001, when Vitra received the manufacturing rights from Prouvé’s heirs. Alongside the classical collection, Tecta also developed new furniture designs with designers such as Stefan Wewerka and Alison and Peter Smithson. Axel Bruchhäuser opened his chair museum, Burg Beverungen (today the Kragstuhlmuseum) in 1979, which moved to the production site in a new building designed by Peter Smithson in 2003.

The impact of the oil crisis in the 1970s led to numerous changes in strategy and ownership; the firm also produced office furniture for a number of years. Since 2010, the company has produced variants of the model AA (1951) as well as the matching AO table by Florent Lasbleiz.<br><br>Airborne [website] &lt;http://www. airborne.fr&gt; accessed 24.10.2014.<br>Deligny, Pierre, *Airborne 1945–1975* (Paris: les Modernistes, 2012).<br>Forest, Dominique, ed., *Mobi Boom.

Knoll, born into a German furniture manufacturing family, founded his eponymous company in New York City in 1938, the same year that he emigrated to the United States. Originally, Knoll had planned to import European furniture, but the outbreak of World War II forced Knoll to change his plans. Starting in 1941, he collaborated with Jens Risom, producing Risom’s simple, modern furniture designs in wood. That same year, Knoll also began to work with Florence Schust, who took over as director of Knoll’s planning department in 1943. In 1946, Florence Schust and Hans Knoll married. In that same year, the company was renamed Knoll Associates and in 1968 it changed its name again to Knoll International. Thanks to Florence Knoll, who had worked for a time with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge and had studied and become friends with Mies van der Rohe, the firm gained the exclusive right to reissue Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Chair as early as 1948. In the years that followed, the firm also produced the work of many other well-known designers, including Harry Bertoia, Isamu Noguchi, George Nakashima, and Eero Saarinen. Saarinen’s Tulip series (1955–57) became the most famous Knoll furniture line. Both with this portfolio and with Florence Knoll’s many own designs, the firm influenced the International Style in the post-war period with its furnishings for offices and private homes. After Hans Knoll’s death in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as director of the company. The firm strengthened its ties with European designers and dealers, such as Wohnbedarf in Switzerland. This led to Knoll’s production of designs by Ilmari Tapiovaara and Hans Bellmann. Herbert Matter designed Knoll’s advertising. When Florence Knoll retired in 1965, Robert Cadwallader took over the company’s management. In 1968, Knoll acquired the Italian company Gavina, and with it the manufacturing rights for important designs by Marcel Breuer. The firm also collaborated with numerous female Italian designers during this period, including Cini Boeri and Gae Aulenti. In 1968 Massimo Vignelli designed a new corporate identity for the firm which is still used today. In the 1970s, the company added models by designers from the United States, including Charles Pollock, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, and later Frank O. Gehry. The Musée des Arts décoratifs in Paris dedicated an exhibition to the firm in 1972, *Knoll au Louvre*. The company has changed hands several times in recent decades and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. In addition to home furnishings, Knoll concentrates on the production of office furnishings and textiles. In 1997, Knoll opened a company museum at its headquarters in East Greenville, Pennsylvania.<br><br>‘Knoll – Im Haut- und Knochen-Stil’, *Der Spiegel*, 16, 1960, 64–75.<br>Knoll [website] &lt;http://www.knoll.com&gt; accessed 17.11.2014.<br>Lutz, Brian, *Knoll: A Modernist Universe* (New York: Rizzoli, 2010).<br>Rouland, Steven and Linda Rouland, *Knoll Furniture: 1938–1960* (Atglen: Schiffer Publishing, 1999).<br>","PerFullText":"SO+SD | Produzent | Knoll Associates | Knoll Associates | United States | New York | United States | Knoll Associates | Hans G.

Starting in 1941, he collaborated with Jens Risom, producing Risom’s simple, modern furniture designs in wood. That same year, Knoll also began to work with Florence Schust, who took over as director of Knoll’s planning department in 1943. In 1946, Florence Schust and Hans Knoll married. In that same year, the company was renamed Knoll Associates and in 1968 it changed its name again to Knoll International. Thanks to Florence Knoll, who had worked for a time with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge and had studied and become friends with Mies van der Rohe, the firm gained the exclusive right to reissue Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Chair as early as 1948. In the years that followed, the firm also produced the work of many other well-known designers, including Harry Bertoia, Isamu Noguchi, George Nakashima, and Eero Saarinen. Saarinen’s Tulip series (1955–57) became the most famous Knoll furniture line. Both with this portfolio and with Florence Knoll’s many own designs, the firm influenced the International Style in the post-war period with its furnishings for offices and private homes. After Hans Knoll’s death in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as director of the company. The firm strengthened its ties with European designers and dealers, such as Wohnbedarf in Switzerland. This led to Knoll’s production of designs by Ilmari Tapiovaara and Hans Bellmann. Herbert Matter designed Knoll’s advertising. When Florence Knoll retired in 1965, Robert Cadwallader took over the company’s management. In 1968, Knoll acquired the Italian company Gavina, and with it the manufacturing rights for important designs by Marcel Breuer. The firm also collaborated with numerous female Italian designers during this period, including Cini Boeri and Gae Aulenti. In 1968 Massimo Vignelli designed a new corporate identity for the firm which is still used today. In the 1970s, the company added models by designers from the United States, including Charles Pollock, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, and later Frank O. Gehry. The Musée des Arts décoratifs in Paris dedicated an exhibition to the firm in 1972, *Knoll au Louvre*. The company has changed hands several times in recent decades and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. In addition to home furnishings, Knoll concentrates on the production of office furnishings and textiles. In 1997, Knoll opened a company museum at its headquarters in East Greenville, Pennsylvania.<br><br>‘Knoll – Im Haut- und Knochen-Stil’, *Der Spiegel*, 16, 1960, 64–75.<br>Knoll [website] &lt;http://www.knoll.com&gt; accessed 17.11.2014.<br>Lutz, Brian, *Knoll: A Modernist Universe* (New York: Rizzoli, 2010).<br>Rouland, Steven and Linda Rouland, *Knoll Furniture: 1938–1960* (Atglen: Schiffer Publishing, 1999).<br>","id":5019},{"_id":5173,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:29.644+0000"},"PerId":5173,"PerMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:47:32.000+0000"},"PerDomain":"SO+SD","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent","PerNameTxt":"Gufram","PerNameSortedTxt":"Gufram","PerNationalityTxt":"Italy","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Barolo","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Italy","PerDisplay":"Gufram","PerObjectRel":[{"ObjId":40460,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0002","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1204","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Cactus","ObjDesigner":"Franco Mello","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1971","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40460.jpg"},{"ObjId":40759,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2732","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1170","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Attica","ObjDesigner":"Studio65","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1972","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40759.jpg"},{"ObjId":42254,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2722","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1053","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Capitello","ObjDesigner":"Studio65","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1971","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/42254.jpg"},{"ObjId":41888,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0003","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1019","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"I Sassi","ObjDesigner":"Piero Gilardi","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1967/68","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/41888.jpg"},{"ObjId":40588,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2731","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1056-2","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Marilyn/Bocca","ObjDesigner":"Studio65","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1970","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40588.jpg"}],"PerMarkdown":"Founded in Turin, Italy, in 1952 by the Gugliermetto brothers as Gugliermetto Fratelli Mobile, the company changed its name to Gufram in 1966 and began production of offbeat furniture designs.

In 1950, they established a subsidiary in Weil am Rhein, Germany, under the name Vitra. Vitra AG was founded in Switzerland in 1953 with the objective of producing small furniture and household appliances. That same year on a visit to the United States, Willi Fehlbaum discovered the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames, whereupon he approached the American manufacturer Herman Miller to obtain the production rights for the European market. Shortly after the licence agreement was finalised in 1957, Fehlbaum began producing the Herman Miller Collection, which also included designs by George Nelson along with the Eames’ furniture. In the years that followed, the pieces were distributed under various company names: in Switzerland first by Contura S.A., later by the Basel-based Herman Miller AG, and in Germany by Fehlbaum GmbH. From 1983 onwards, however, the furniture was exclusively sold under the Vitra label.<br><br>Vitra also began building up its own furniture portfolio from the late 1960s onwards. In 1967, a plastic chair without back legs went into production after several years in development; designed by Verner Panton, it would become widely known as the Panton Chair. In 1976, the company’s first office chair came on the market: the Vitramat designed by Wolfgang Deisig. At the same time Vitra continued to produce shopfittings, having built facilities for the purpose in Weil am Rhein in the 1950s. Vitra’s headquarters, however, have always been located in Switzerland, first in Basel and now in Birsfelden.<br><br>Willi and Erika Fehlbaum handed over the company to their sons in 1977; Rolf Fehlbaum took charge of the furniture production section, which was united under the name Vitra, while Raymond Fehlbaum was now responsible for shopfitting services under the name Vitrashop.<br><br>After a lightning strike in 1981 had caused a major fire that destroyed large parts of the production facilities in Weil am Rhein, new factory halls were swiftly constructed on the basis of designs by Nicholas Grimshaw. In the years that followed, Rolf Fehlbaum commissioned further notable architects to design new buildings for the Vitra Campus.<br><br>Vitra continued to grow throughout the 1980s, with its main focus being office furniture. Significant contributors in this area were Mario Bellini (from 1984), Antonio Citterio (from 1985), Alberto Meda (from 1996), and Jasper Morrison (from 1989).

In 1950, they established a subsidiary in Weil am Rhein, Germany, under the name Vitra. Vitra AG was founded in Switzerland in 1953 with the objective of producing small furniture and household appliances. That same year on a visit to the United States, Willi Fehlbaum discovered the furniture of Charles and Ray Eames, whereupon he approached the American manufacturer Herman Miller to obtain the production rights for the European market. Shortly after the licence agreement was finalised in 1957, Fehlbaum began producing the Herman Miller Collection, which also included designs by George Nelson along with the Eames’ furniture. In the years that followed, the pieces were distributed under various company names: in Switzerland first by Contura S.A., later by the Basel-based Herman Miller AG, and in Germany by Fehlbaum GmbH. From 1983 onwards, however, the furniture was exclusively sold under the Vitra label.<br><br>Vitra also began building up its own furniture portfolio from the late 1960s onwards. In 1967, a plastic chair without back legs went into production after several years in development; designed by Verner Panton, it would become widely known as the Panton Chair. In 1976, the company’s first office chair came on the market: the Vitramat designed by Wolfgang Deisig. At the same time Vitra continued to produce shopfittings, having built facilities for the purpose in Weil am Rhein in the 1950s. Vitra’s headquarters, however, have always been located in Switzerland, first in Basel and now in Birsfelden.<br><br>Willi and Erika Fehlbaum handed over the company to their sons in 1977; Rolf Fehlbaum took charge of the furniture production section, which was united under the name Vitra, while Raymond Fehlbaum was now responsible for shopfitting services under the name Vitrashop.<br><br>After a lightning strike in 1981 had caused a major fire that destroyed large parts of the production facilities in Weil am Rhein, new factory halls were swiftly constructed on the basis of designs by Nicholas Grimshaw. In the years that followed, Rolf Fehlbaum commissioned further notable architects to design new buildings for the Vitra Campus.<br><br>Vitra continued to grow throughout the 1980s, with its main focus being office furniture. Significant contributors in this area were Mario Bellini (from 1984), Antonio Citterio (from 1985), Alberto Meda (from 1996), and Jasper Morrison (from 1989).

In 1915, he modernized the manufacturing process, making it possible to produce furniture in larger quantities.

Under their guidance, the company began to work in a new stylistic idiom made possible by the wood-bending procedures they had perfected. In the 1930s, the company temporarily held the manufacturing rights for Thonet furniture and manufactured tubular steel furniture. Among the well-known designers of this time were Kaare Klint, Mogens Lassen, and Fritz Schlegel; in 1933, Arne Jacobsen designed his first chair for Fritz Hansen. By the mid-1940s, the company began collaborating with designers Hans J. Wegner and Børge Mogensen. In 1950, making use of their experiences using moulded plywood for aircraft construction during World War II, the company experimented with serial furniture production with the AX Chair by Peter Hvidt and Orla Mølgaard.

Aside from producing Biedermeier furniture designs, he developed a procedure for bending laminated wood. Since Thonet had heavy debts in Boppard, he moved in 1842 to Vienna, where he began working for the furniture company Carl Leistler & Sohn. In 1849, Thonet and his sons started their own company in Vienna. In 1850, their workshop produced a new kind of chair for the Viennese coffee house Daum, which was lightweight and therefore economical. It was later known as the model No. 4. In 1851, the firm presented its furniture to an international audience at the World’s Fair in London. In 1853, Michael Thonet handed the reins of the company to his sons, who continued production under the name Gebrüder Thonet. In order to protect itself from imitators, the firm patented its procedure for bending solid wood in 1856. Furniture production was gradually switched to this new procedure over the following years. In 1857 Gebrüder Thonet created their first furniture factory, in Koritschan, Moravia (now Koryčany, Czech Republic). By 1880 they had established five additional factories in Eastern Europe. The business was internationalized, with branches worldwide. In 1859, the firm brought out its No. 14 chair, which could be dismantled for transport. It became Thonet’s most successful furniture design. The first German branch was opened in Frankenberg an der Eder in 1889. By 1900 the firm had more than fifty production plants. At this time, Thonet also began working on new chair designs with architects such as Otto Wagner and Otto Prutscher. Numerous designs by Adolf Loos and Josef Hoffmann were added to the range, thanks to the 1922 merger with Mundus, which had created the firm Thonet-Mundus – the world’s largest furniture manufacturer. Starting in 1928, Gebrüder Thonet began buying manufacturing rights for tubular steel furniture and taking over smaller manufacturers of such furniture. Thus, the firm obtained the rights to the designs of Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, Anton Lorenz, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Mart Stam, among others. Thonet-Mundus was dissolved as an international network of companies and brands in the late 1930s. During World War II, many factories were destroyed and the Eastern European branches were expropriated. The Czech branch was turned into the Ton brand in 1948; the former Austrian brand Gebrüder Thonet Vienna was renamed Wiener GTV Design in 2013 and is now based in Torino, Italy. Georg Thonet reopened his German plant in Frankenberg in 1945 and resumed production of wood and tubular steel furniture, including designs by Eddie Harlis and Verner Panton. Thonet was honoured with an exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1953.

Starting in 1928, Gebrüder Thonet began buying manufacturing rights for tubular steel furniture and taking over smaller manufacturers of such furniture. Thus, the firm obtained the rights to the designs of Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, Anton Lorenz, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Mart Stam, among others. Thonet-Mundus was dissolved as an international network of companies and brands in the late 1930s. During World War II, many factories were destroyed and the Eastern European branches were expropriated. The Czech branch was turned into the Ton brand in 1948; the former Austrian brand Gebrüder Thonet Vienna was renamed Wiener GTV Design in 2013 and is now based in Torino, Italy. Georg Thonet reopened his German plant in Frankenberg in 1945 and resumed production of wood and tubular steel furniture, including designs by Eddie Harlis and Verner Panton. Thonet was honoured with an exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1953. Today, Thonet’s range includes pieces by designers such as Stefan Diez and James Irvine, in addition to the classic designs in its collection.<br><br>Mang, Karl, ed., *Das Haus Thonet* (Vienna: Brüder Rosenbaum, 1969).<br>Ottillinger, Eva B., ed., *Gebrüder Thonet, Möbel aus gebogenem Holz* (Vienna: Böhlau, 2003).<br>Thonet [website] &lt;http://www.thonet.de&gt; accessed 02.12.2014.<br>Vegesack, Alexander von, *Das Thonet Buch* (Munich: Bangert, 1987).<br><br>","id":5867},{"_id":5958,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:29.646+0000"},"PerId":5958,"PerMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:47:32.000+0000"},"PerDomain":"SO+SD","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent","PerNameTxt":"General Fireproofing Company","PerNameSortedTxt":"General Fireproofing Company","PerNationalityTxt":"United States","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Youngstown, Ohio","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"United States","PerDisplay":"General Fireproofing Company","PerObjectRel":[{"ObjId":39502,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0932","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MUS-1049-3","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"No. 4295/GoodForm","ObjDesigner":"Anonym (Firmenentwurf) / Anonymous (in-house design)","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1931/32","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/39502.jpg"},{"ObjId":43165,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2433","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MUS-1108-1","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"40/4 Chair/40-in-4; Rowland Stacking Chair","ObjDesigner":"David Rowland","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1955–1963","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/43165.jpg"}],"PerMarkdown":"The company was founded in 1902 in Youngstown, Ohio, USA, to produce fireproof construction materials.

The company changed its name several times in the ensuing decades. By 1931 it was called Asko-Avonius Huonekalutehtaat; as of 1940 Askon Tehtaat; in 1966 Asko-Upo, and in 1981 it became Asko, though this shortened form had actually been used as a brand name since 1931. Asko was one of the first firms to apply Henry Ford’s mass production principles to furniture manufacture following World War I. The first company-owned retail store opened in 1919, quickly spawning a chain of shops where, initially, traditional furniture was sold. Arttu Brummer and Gurli Johansson submitted their first designs soon thereafter. The first salaried designer was Maija Heikinheimo, employed from 1932 to 1935 until she left to work at Artek. The subsidiary Upo was founded in 1938; the specialized supplier of metal furniture parts started producing plastic tubing in 1965. Under Ilmari Tapiovaara, artistic director of Asko from 1938 to 1941, the firm began to modernize its product line. In the 1950s, in addition to producing Tapiovaara’s wooden chair models including Mademoiselle (1956), Domus (1946/47), Pelimanni (1957), and Aslak (1958), the company developed a comprehensive interior design range with wall units, upholstered furniture, and beds, all distributed via retail stores in European and Japanese cities. This development also served to popularize Scandinavian design.

After bringing in a partner, the firm changed its name that same year to Schmidt und Engelbrecht, Dresdner Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst. In 1899, after Schmidt found his new partner, Julius Müller, the company’s name changed again, this time to Dresdner Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst Schmidt und Müller, and remained so until Müller’s death in 1902, after which Schmidt took over Müller’s shares. Two more name changes then followed: first to Dresdner, then to Deutsche Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst, Karl Schmidt. After the merger with the Münchner Werkstätten für Wohnungseinrichtung, Karl Bertsch, in 1907 the two companies began trading under the shared name Deutsche Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst, Dresden und München. The production was characterized by reform furniture; Schmidt managed to engage renowned artists and architects such as Johann Vincenz Cissarz or Richard Riemerschmid for the designs. The company took part in important exhibitions, including the 1899 Deutsche Kunstausstellung in Dresden and in the 1900 and 1904 World’s Fairs, held in Paris and St. Louis, respectively. In 1907, Karl Schmidt was co-initiator and founding member of the Deutscher Werkbund. In 1909 he supported the construction of Hellerau, Germany’s first garden city, located to the northeast of Dresden, built according to plans by Richard Riemerschmid. The Deutsche Werkstätten, which by then employed 250 workers, moved to its new factory site in Hellerau in 1910. The company became one of the largest and most important furniture manufacturers in Germany and was represented at all major exhibitions. Assembly lines became part of the production process in Hellerau from 1927 onwards. In 1935, production of Bruno Paul’s range of so-called *Aufbaumöbel* (unit furniture) was launched. Because the company was involved in armaments production during World War II, it was expropriated after the war and nationalized in 1951 as VEB Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau. In the 1950s, in addition to producing furniture parts for other companies, the company made the sectional furniture series 602 by Franz Ehrlich, as well as the MDW wall units from the design collective around Rudolf Horn starting from 1967. From 1969 until the end of the German Democratic Republic, the factory was the parent company of the VEB Möbelkombinat (furniture collective) Hellerau, responsible for about one-third of all furniture produced in the GDR. It also played a major role in interior design for special state projects.

After bringing in a partner, the firm changed its name that same year to Schmidt und Engelbrecht, Dresdner Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst. In 1899, after Schmidt found his new partner, Julius Müller, the company’s name changed again, this time to Dresdner Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst Schmidt und Müller, and remained so until Müller’s death in 1902, after which Schmidt took over Müller’s shares. Two more name changes then followed: first to Dresdner, then to Deutsche Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst, Karl Schmidt. After the merger with the Münchner Werkstätten für Wohnungseinrichtung, Karl Bertsch, in 1907 the two companies began trading under the shared name Deutsche Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst, Dresden und München. The production was characterized by reform furniture; Schmidt managed to engage renowned artists and architects such as Johann Vincenz Cissarz or Richard Riemerschmid for the designs. The company took part in important exhibitions, including the 1899 Deutsche Kunstausstellung in Dresden and in the 1900 and 1904 World’s Fairs, held in Paris and St. Louis, respectively. In 1907, Karl Schmidt was co-initiator and founding member of the Deutscher Werkbund. In 1909 he supported the construction of Hellerau, Germany’s first garden city, located to the northeast of Dresden, built according to plans by Richard Riemerschmid. The Deutsche Werkstätten, which by then employed 250 workers, moved to its new factory site in Hellerau in 1910. The company became one of the largest and most important furniture manufacturers in Germany and was represented at all major exhibitions. Assembly lines became part of the production process in Hellerau from 1927 onwards. In 1935, production of Bruno Paul’s range of so-called *Aufbaumöbel* (unit furniture) was launched. Because the company was involved in armaments production during World War II, it was expropriated after the war and nationalized in 1951 as VEB Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau. In the 1950s, in addition to producing furniture parts for other companies, the company made the sectional furniture series 602 by Franz Ehrlich, as well as the MDW wall units from the design collective around Rudolf Horn starting from 1967. From 1969 until the end of the German Democratic Republic, the factory was the parent company of the VEB Möbelkombinat (furniture collective) Hellerau, responsible for about one-third of all furniture produced in the GDR. It also played a major role in interior design for special state projects. In 1991, as part of the privatization process following German unification, thirty new firms were formed out of the former collective. Today’s Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau have largely focused on interiors for estates, yachts, and boardrooms. In 1998, the original factory building was sold and renovated.

In 1925 he met Le Corbusier and Robert Mallet-Stevens in Paris. Modern machinery enabled him to produce sheet metal elements for buildings, in addition to craft objects. His contacts with modernists generated extensive orders for door and window frames, glazed façades, staircases, and movable metal walls. Prouvé was already turning out his first furniture models, as well, and in 1930 he began operating as a *constructeur* (constructor). For both architecture and furniture, he applied metal-folding principles to achieve highly sturdy constructions that used as little material as possible. In 1931 he founded Ateliers Jean Prouvé in Nancy, which won its first big contract to furnish the new dormitory at Université de Nancy. In 1933 he set up a department dedicated to research and planning. Aiming to mass-produce the construction components required for his projects, Prouvé made a number of large equipment investments throughout the 1930s, which led to the company’s precarious financial situation despite increasing sales. In 1938, a department for furniture development was set up, mainly to equip schools and offices.

founded in 1905 in Zeeland, Michigan, USA, with the aim of producing historicist furniture. In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree joined the company, becoming its director ten years later. For a time, the firm operated under the name Michigan Star Furniture Company. In 1923, De Pree took over the company with help from his father-in-law, after whom he re-named the firm the Herman Miller Furniture Company. Until 1932, the company produced conventional wooden furniture. When Gilbert Rhode became head designer, he worked to modernize the company’s designs. In 1933, Herman Miller presented its first modern collection; by 1936, traditional pieces disappeared from the catalogue. After Rhode’s death in 1945, George Nelson took over his position and brought renowned, innovative designers to work at Herman Miller, including Charles and Ray Eames, Alexander Girard, Isamu Noguchi, and others. Nelson and his New York office also produced their own key designs. Ultimately, Herman Miller became one of the most important American manufacturers of modern furniture for homes and offices. In 1948, the firm earned accolades for its Eames models of moulded plywood and fibreglass-reinforced plastic. In 1957, Herman Miller assigned the Swiss company Vitra the manufacturing licenses for the European market. Three years later, in 1960, the firm removed ‘Furniture Company’ from its name; it also made the Herman Miller Research Division in Ann Arbor, Michigan, largely independent. With the introduction of the Action Office, designed by Robert Probst and George Nelson, Herman Miller set a new standard for office furniture and reaffirmed its role as one of the most important manufacturers in this market. In 1962 Hugh De Pree succeeded his father as the company head. By the mid-1960s, the company had more than 150 sales offices spanning several continents. In the 1970s and 1980s, additional manufacturing plants opened in the United States and in Europe. During these years, Herman Miller’s furniture designers included Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf.

Korhonen became managing director in 1913. In addition to producing furniture and wood for construction, and trading in cabinetmakerʼs supplies and associated products, the company was active in the lumber trade. In 1912, the company-owned sales room was moved to Turku. At first, the company delivered materials to other furniture manufacturers, including Nikolai Boman. In the late 1920s, Otto Korhonen and Alvar Aalto met and began a productive collaboration while designing the interior of the Southern Finland Agricultural Cooperative. In 1929, Aalto’s furniture (manufactured by Korhonen’s company) was shown at an exhibition marking the 700th anniversary of Turku’s founding. In the early 1930s, Korhonen played an important role in the technical development of Aalto’s plywood furniture, which was used, for example, in the interior design of the Paimio Sanatorium. Increasingly, Korhonen tailored his production to Aalto’s needs. After Korhonen’s death and the establishment of Artek in 1935, exclusive sales rights for Aalto’s furniture were transferred to Artek, while Huonekalu- ja Rakennustyötehdas remained their exclusive manufacturer.

In addition to producing furniture and wood for construction, and trading in cabinetmakerʼs supplies and associated products, the company was active in the lumber trade. In 1912, the company-owned sales room was moved to Turku. At first, the company delivered materials to other furniture manufacturers, including Nikolai Boman. In the late 1920s, Otto Korhonen and Alvar Aalto met and began a productive collaboration while designing the interior of the Southern Finland Agricultural Cooperative.

In 1927, the brothers founded their company, Cassina Amadeo, in Meda, north of Milan in Italy. At first they produced chairs and tables, and then increasingly finely crafted upholstered seating furniture in a historicist style. In the early 1930s, orders from the major stores La Rinascente and Mobilificio di Fogliano led to the expansion of the workshops, a transition to machine production, and the first designs that no longer took their cues from the past. In 1935, the company was renamed Figli di Amadeo Cassina. After the war, the move towards mass production continued with major contracts for furnishing Italian passenger ships. And it was also through ship outfitting that the collaboration with Gio Ponti, the firm’s first artistic advisor, came about. Ponti delivered designs for the first-class salon of the luxury liner *Andrea Doria*, which were then executed by Cassina. Together with Ponti, Cassina subsequently developed various chairs, including the Superleggera, which brought international recognition to the firm. In the 1950s, Franco Albini and Ico Parisi were among Cassina’s designers; in the 1960s, Afra and Tobia Scarpa, Vico Magistretti, and Mario Bellini joined the team. The 1970s saw daring designs like the concept car Kar-a-sutra by Mario Bellini (for the exhibition *Italy: The New Domestic Landscape*) in New York. With the AEO lounge chair by Paolo Deganello, the I Feltri lounge chair by Gaetano Pesce, and chair objects by Alessandro Mendini, Cassina supported the quest for new approaches outside the mainstream. Starting in 1964, in addition to producing modern furniture designs and participating in start-ups like C&B Italia, Cassina became one of the first furniture companies to reissue modern furniture classics. Since that time, designs by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, and Charlotte Perriand have been reissued in the product line I Maestri. With additional models by Erik Gunnar Asplund, Gerrit Rietveld, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Frank Lloyd Wright, and others, this historical collection is constantly expanding. Recent designers for Cassina include Konstantin Grcic, Patrick Norguet, Zaha Hadid, and Philippe Starck.

Aside from producing Biedermeier furniture designs, he developed a procedure for bending laminated wood. Since Thonet had heavy debts in Boppard, he moved in 1842 to Vienna, where he began working for the furniture company Carl Leistler & Sohn. In 1849, Thonet and his sons started their own company in Vienna. In 1850, their workshop produced a new kind of chair for the Viennese coffee house Daum, which was lightweight and therefore economical. It was later known as the model No. 4. In 1851, the firm presented its furniture to an international audience at the World’s Fair in London. In 1853, Michael Thonet handed the reins of the company to his sons, who continued production under the name Gebrüder Thonet. In order to protect itself from imitators, the firm patented its procedure for bending solid wood in 1856. Furniture production was gradually switched to this new procedure over the following years. In 1857 Gebrüder Thonet created their first furniture factory, in Koritschan, Moravia (now Koryčany, Czech Republic). By 1880 they had established five additional factories in Eastern Europe. The business was internationalized, with branches worldwide. In 1859, the firm brought out its No. 14 chair, which could be dismantled for transport. It became Thonet’s most successful furniture design. The first German branch was opened in Frankenberg an der Eder in 1889. By 1900 the firm had more than fifty production plants. At this time, Thonet also began working on new chair designs with architects such as Otto Wagner and Otto Prutscher. Numerous designs by Adolf Loos and Josef Hoffmann were added to the range, thanks to the 1922 merger with Mundus, which had created the firm Thonet-Mundus – the world’s largest furniture manufacturer. Starting in 1928, Gebrüder Thonet began buying manufacturing rights for tubular steel furniture and taking over smaller manufacturers of such furniture. Thus, the firm obtained the rights to the designs of Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, Anton Lorenz, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Mart Stam, among others. Thonet-Mundus was dissolved as an international network of companies and brands in the late 1930s. During World War II, many factories were destroyed and the Eastern European branches were expropriated.

Today, Thonet’s range includes pieces by designers such as Stefan Diez and James Irvine, in addition to the classic designs in its collection.<br><br>Mang, Karl, ed., *Das Haus Thonet* (Vienna: Brüder Rosenbaum, 1969).<br>Ottillinger, Eva B., ed., *Gebrüder Thonet, Möbel aus gebogenem Holz* (Vienna: Böhlau, 2003).<br>Thonet [website] &lt;http://www.thonet.de&gt; accessed 02.12.2014.<br>Vegesack, Alexander von, *Das Thonet Buch* (Munich: Bangert, 1987).<br><br>","id":9707},{"_id":9877,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:29.655+0000"},"PerId":9877,"PerMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:47:32.000+0000"},"PerDomain":"SO+SD","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent","PerNameTxt":"Wohnbedarf","PerNameSortedTxt":"Wohnbedarf","PerNationalityTxt":"Switzerland","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Zurich","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Switzerland","PerDisplay":"Wohnbedarf","PerObjectRel":[{"ObjId":42238,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1414","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MCH-1012","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled/Tripod Chair","ObjDesigner":"Max Bill","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1949","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/42238.jpg"},{"ObjId":40494,"ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"SCH-1012","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Kolonial Fauteuil Mod. 28, Kolonialstuhl Mod. 28/Safari Chair","ObjDesigner":"Wilhelm Kienzle","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1928","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40494.jpg"}],"PerMarkdown":"G Wohnbedarf was launched in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1931 by the art historian and modernist supporter Sigfried Giedion, the architect Werner Max Moser, and the businessman Rudolf Graber. They were prompted by the establishment of the Werkbundsiedlung Neubühl in Zurich, whose model homes the company furnished from 1932. As Graber wrote in 1931, ‘a selection of more practical and formally perfect furniture, textiles, and lighting fixtures’ should be made available, while ‘at the same time industry should be taught to value true quality’. Not only did Wohnbedarf pave the way for important Swiss contributions to Modernism; the company also connected early on with the European avant-garde. Thus Wohnbedarf contributed substantially to spreading the modern language of form in Switzerland. The Zurich store, also opened in 1931, was among the first in Europe to sell exclusively modern *Typenmöbel* (type-furniture). The limited range consisted primarily of designs by Werner Max Moser, Max Ernst Haefeli, Alfred Roth, Rudolf and Flora Steiger-Crawford, Alvar Aalto, Le Corbusier, and Marcel Breuer, who designed the salesrooms in 1933 and the aluminium furniture for Wohnbedarf. Max Bill created the lettering for the logo, still used today. The furniture was produced mostly by the manufacturers Embru and Horgen-Glarus as well as by various carpenters. The advertising was created by Herbert Bayer, Max Bill, Pierre Gauchat, and Richard Paul Lohse. In 1932, a second, financially independent Wohnbedarf store opened in Basel under the direction of Paul Matzinger; others opened later in Geneva and Lugano, but closed again rather quickly. Licenses were assigned in other European countries as well. After Giedion and Moser were let go from the firm in 1935, there was no further in-house development of modernist furniture for a time. The late 1940s saw the start of a collaboration with the American company Knoll, whose furniture Wohnbedarf sold exclusively over the coming decades, along with the first series of Hans Gugelot’s Furniture System M125.

Knoll, born into a German furniture manufacturing family, founded his eponymous company in New York City in 1938, the same year that he emigrated to the United States. Originally, Knoll had planned to import European furniture, but the outbreak of World War II forced Knoll to change his plans. Starting in 1941, he collaborated with Jens Risom, producing Risom’s simple, modern furniture designs in wood. That same year, Knoll also began to work with Florence Schust, who took over as director of Knoll’s planning department in 1943. In 1946, Florence Schust and Hans Knoll married. In that same year, the company was renamed Knoll Associates and in 1968 it changed its name again to Knoll International. Thanks to Florence Knoll, who had worked for a time with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge and had studied and become friends with Mies van der Rohe, the firm gained the exclusive right to reissue Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Chair as early as 1948. In the years that followed, the firm also produced the work of many other well-known designers, including Harry Bertoia, Isamu Noguchi, George Nakashima, and Eero Saarinen. Saarinen’s Tulip series (1955–57) became the most famous Knoll furniture line. Both with this portfolio and with Florence Knoll’s many own designs, the firm influenced the International Style in the post-war period with its furnishings for offices and private homes. After Hans Knoll’s death in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as director of the company. The firm strengthened its ties with European designers and dealers, such as Wohnbedarf in Switzerland. This led to Knoll’s production of designs by Ilmari Tapiovaara and Hans Bellmann. Herbert Matter designed Knoll’s advertising. When Florence Knoll retired in 1965, Robert Cadwallader took over the company’s management. In 1968, Knoll acquired the Italian company Gavina, and with it the manufacturing rights for important designs by Marcel Breuer. The firm also collaborated with numerous female Italian designers during this period, including Cini Boeri and Gae Aulenti. In 1968 Massimo Vignelli designed a new corporate identity for the firm which is still used today. In the 1970s, the company added models by designers from the United States, including Charles Pollock, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, and later Frank O. Gehry. The Musée des Arts décoratifs in Paris dedicated an exhibition to the firm in 1972, *Knoll au Louvre*. The company has changed hands several times in recent decades and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2004. In addition to home furnishings, Knoll concentrates on the production of office furnishings and textiles.

It cannot be accurately predicted how the metal will fold, thus making every item unique, highlighting the stool’s sculptural character.<br><br>Text: Donatella

With the Carenza, Pesce exploited the polyurethane expansion process by deliberately omitting air vents in the mould. In a hermetic mould, polyurethane expansion is not controllable because the remaining air prevents the material from spreading evenly, leading to an unpredictable shape.<sup>1</sup> The shelves resemble demolished walls, with rough edges resulting from fissures made by the trapped air.

In a hermetic mould, polyurethane expansion is not controllable because the remaining air prevents the material from spreading evenly, leading to an unpredictable shape.<sup>1</sup> The shelves resemble demolished walls, with rough edges resulting from fissures made by the trapped air.

Department stores and supermarkets but also junk yards provide plenty of ideas and material. The point of departure for Consumer’s Rest is a supermarket shopping cart, a standard, ubiquitous everyday object, which hardly appears to have design value. Like Marcel Duchamp’s ready-mades, Consumer’s Rest is an everyday object chosen from among vast numbers of manufactured goods, reinterpreted, and invested with a new function. Stiletto takes the shopping cart apart, reshapes it, and sprays each half with different color tones.

Wegner gained world renown for his ability to give the old cabinetmaker’s craft a modern and functionally motivated expression. Beyond his work on high quality cabinetmaker’s furniture, he also experimented with modern wood handling technologies such as the moulding of plywood. In 1948 he designed a low chair and a sofa with plywood shells for Fritz Hansen that were both put into production and may be seen as precursors of the Three-Legged Shell Chair. After 1949, Hansen and Wegner had to work hard to keep up with the international demand for modern cabinetmaker’s furniture and were not able to continue their plywood experiments. Wegner revisited the shell chair theme in 1963, when he created several 1:5 chair models to test different underframes. Adding a space between the layers of wood at the peak of the bend mould enabled a very strong construction and added a decorative feature, while the oblique angle of the legs provides stability just as much as a light and graphic appearance.

Wegner | Hans J. Wegner gained world renown for his ability to give the old cabinetmaker’s craft a modern and functionally motivated expression. Beyond his work on high quality cabinetmaker’s furniture, he also experimented with modern wood handling technologies such as the moulding of plywood. In 1948 he designed a low chair and a sofa with plywood shells for Fritz Hansen that were both put into production and may be seen as precursors of the Three-Legged Shell Chair. After 1949, Hansen and Wegner had to work hard to keep up with the international demand for modern cabinetmaker’s furniture and were not able to continue their plywood experiments. Wegner revisited the shell chair theme in 1963, when he created several 1:5 chair models to test different underframes. Adding a space between the layers of wood at the peak of the bend mould enabled a very strong construction and added a decorative feature, while the oblique angle of the legs provides stability just as much as a light and graphic appearance. Viewed from the front, the chair’s strictly geometrical structure makes the legs appear to project like radii from the circular expanse of the seat.

When creating the first model in 1941 for André Ligné’s apartment he still used cotton twine for the seat. During his internment in a camp for Japanese Americans between 1942 and 1943 he met the carpenter Gentaro Hikowara, who instructed him in the art of traditional Japanese woodworking techniques.<sup>1</sup> Nakashima subsequently reworked his design and from 1944 used the hand-spun seagrass that gave the chair its name.

When he finally obtained enough resin to start working, he made the first version of a chair that became known as the Karuselli – the carousel chair. Kukkapuro was interested in ergonomics as well as new materials. While playing in the snow with his daughter he noted the impression his body made in a snowdrift, and this inspired him to mould the Karuselli from the shape of his own body. As a designer who liked tinkering in the workshop Kukkapuro quickly moved from sketch to prototype using metal netting with sackcloth, dipping it in plaster, and then forming it. Three years of intensive modelling followed, during which time he also developed the elaborate leather upholstery as well as the amoeba-like shape for the base with its attached steel swing bracket. The latter allowed the suspension of the seat shell, thus avoiding any visual interference with its pure cup shape. Thanks to this combination of bracket and base, the lounge chair not only swivels but also swings gently back and forth. The Karuselli was first presented in 1965 at the International Furniture Fair Cologne. Its international success is largely due to influential design figures like Gio Ponti and Sir Terence Conran, who openly praised the design and not least the chairs’ comfort.<sup>1</sup><br><br><sup>1</sup> Conran, *Terence Conran on Design* (1996), 56.<br><br>Text: Anniina Koivu<br>","ObjFullText":"SO+SD | 2531 | No. 412/Karuselli | 1964 | 1965 | 1964/65 | Swivel lounge chair | 2013> | 1965–1980 Haimi, Helsinki, Finnland | 1980-2013 | MSK-1195 | 1964/65 | Fibreglass-reinforced polyester / chrome-plated steel / rubber / foam rubber padding / leather covering | 89 x 82 x 99 cm | 2531 | Swiveling | Plastic | Lounge chairs | Yrjö Kukkapuro | Fibreglass and plastics were only introduced to the Nordic countries in the late 1950s, and Yrjö Kukkapuro was a young Finnish designer who could not wait to get his hands on the new materials.

Its international success is largely due to influential design figures like Gio Ponti and Sir Terence Conran, who openly praised the design and not least the chairs’ comfort.<sup>1</sup><br><br><sup>1</sup> Conran, *Terence Conran on Design* (1996), 56.<br><br>Text: Anniina Koivu<br>","id":44023},{"_id":44032,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.529+0000"},"ObjId":44032,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0231","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Modell V, Nr. 8","ObjDateFromInt":1895,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1895","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"1895 Kunsttischlerei in/bei Brüssel, Belgien","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MBE-1002","ObjDateTxt":"after 1898","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Ash / fabric covering","ObjDimension":"92,6 x 47,3 x 46,3 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"0231","ObjContentMaterial":"Wood","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"},{"ConId":100376235,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Wood"}],"ObjDesigner":"Henry van de Velde","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":10309,"PerNameTxt":"Henry van de Velde","PerDatingTxt":"1863–1957","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Antwerp","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Belgium","PerTypeVoc":"Designer","PerUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/ArtistModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/10309.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":69117,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/44032.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/44032.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/44032.jpg","ladimensions":[1083,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/44032.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/44032.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"Henry van de Velde, who ranks among the most important Jugendstil designers, made this dining-room chair for his first home, Bloemenwerf, which he designed and erected in Uccle near Brussels in 1896.

Their reputation was formed at the X Triennale di Milano in 1954, where the D70 sofa bed found much acclaim with a novel use of metal frames and polyfoam upholstery as well as a steel mechanism that enabled a fine-grained and precise adjustment of the seat angle.

Their reputation was formed at the X Triennale di Milano in 1954, where the D70 sofa bed found much acclaim with a novel use of metal frames and polyfoam upholstery as well as a steel mechanism that enabled a fine-grained and precise adjustment of the seat angle.

The prototype, called Sandwich, was presented in 1968 at the XIV Triennale in Milan by Cassina, but it was Sormani which produced the line from 1969 until approximately 1974.<br><br>Text: Ignazia Favata / Elisabetta Borgatti<br>","id":44167},{"_id":44245,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.532+0000"},"ObjId":44245,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-10-17T12:12:02.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled/Argyle Chair","ObjDateFromInt":1897,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1897","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"1897 – unknown Francis Smith, Glasgow, Großbritannien","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MGB-1069","ObjDateTxt":"1897","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Stained oak / woven rush","ObjDimension":"136,7 x 50,8 x 48,1 cm","ObjHighlight":"Highlights","ObjContentMaterial":"Wood","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"},{"ConId":100376235,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Wood"},{"ConId":1,"ConTypeUnilang":"Highlights","ConType":"Highlights","ConTxt":"Highlights"}],"ObjDesigner":"Charles Rennie Mackintosh","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":2935,"PerNameTxt":"Charles Rennie Mackintosh","PerDatingTxt":"1868–1928","PerTypeVoc":"Designer","PerUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/ArtistModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/2935.jpg"}],"ObjObjectRel":[{"ObjId":40967,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0234","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MGB-1083","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled/Armchair for the Argyle Street Tea Rooms","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1897","ObjDesigner":"Charles Rennie Mackintosh","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40967.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":69908,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/44245.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/44245.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/44245.jpg","ladimensions":[827,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/44245.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/44245.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"The Scottish architect, designer, and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh numbers amongst the most innovative and industrious designers in Europe around the turn of the twentieth century.

As asbestos-free fibre cement does not have the same load-bearing properties, Guhl and Eternit teamed up in 1997 to develop a re-issue of the Eternit Chair, with two additional ribs moulded into the backrest and underside of the chair providing the requisite sturdiness.<br><br>Text: Claude Lichtenstein<br>","id":44324},{"_id":44338,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.534+0000"},"ObjId":44338,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2834","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Cab, No. 412","ObjDateFromInt":1976,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1976","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"Cassina, Meda, Italien","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1040","ObjDateTxt":"1976","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Lacquered tubular steel / plastic / leather covering","ObjDimension":"81,4 x 51,7 x 46,9 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"2834","ObjContentMaterial":"Leather, Metal","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"},{"ConId":100376238,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Metal"},{"ConId":100376237,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Leather"}],"ObjDesigner":"Mario Bellini","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":8579,"PerNameTxt":"Cassina","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Meda","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Italy","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent"}],"ObjObjectRel":[{"ObjId":42788,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2835","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"DIT-1065","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Grano","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1975","ObjDesigner":"Alessandro Mendini","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/42788.jpg"},{"ObjId":41349,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2812","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"SIT-1013","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Teneride","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1970","ObjDesigner":"Mario Bellini","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/41349.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":71577,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/44338.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/44338.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/44338.jpg","ladimensions":[1238,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/44338.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/44338.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"The Cab chair by Italian designer and architect Mario Bellini consists of two distinct elements: A leather cover is stretched over a bare tubular steel chair frame like a tight skin.

Its development began in 1954 when Yanagi approached a plywood expert at the government Industrial Arts Research Institute (IARI). The Butterfly Stool consists of two symmetrical seven-millimetre plywood shapes, each made of seven sheets of wood veneer, connected with two brass bolts and a stabilizing rod further down. Its curves recall the stool’s eponymous feature, a butterfly’s wings.<sup>1</sup> Its visual simplicity and few parts belies its technical sophistication however and manufacturer Tendo Mokko needed several years to finalize the design and perfect a manufacturing process. This effort exemplifies the shared interest among Japanese designers and manufacturers in exploiting plywood’s material capabilities – they also used the existing knowledge acquired by Charles Eames, Alvar Aalto and the like – to produce beautiful, innovative furniture.

Its development began in 1954 when Yanagi approached a plywood expert at the government Industrial Arts Research Institute (IARI). The Butterfly Stool consists of two symmetrical seven-millimetre plywood shapes, each made of seven sheets of wood veneer, connected with two brass bolts and a stabilizing rod further down. Its curves recall the stool’s eponymous feature, a butterfly’s wings.<sup>1</sup> Its visual simplicity and few parts belies its technical sophistication however and manufacturer Tendo Mokko needed several years to finalize the design and perfect a manufacturing process. This effort exemplifies the shared interest among Japanese designers and manufacturers in exploiting plywood’s material capabilities – they also used the existing knowledge acquired by Charles Eames, Alvar Aalto and the like – to produce beautiful, innovative furniture.

is a patented seating concept conceived by inventor Hans Christian Mengshoel. He explored the idea of reducing the load carried by the sitter’s spine by transferring a portion of this weight to the legs and knees to allow for a more balanced and ergonomically superior posture. In 1978, Mengshoel invited Norwegian designers Peter Opsvik, Svein Gusrud, and Oddvin Rykken to develop furniture that would meet these requirements. Inspired by the Danish physician A. C. Mandal, who in 1976/77 had called for the development of chairs with a more open angle between the torso and thighs, Peter Opsvik had already begun experimenting with similar ideas. He equipped his version of an ergonomic stool, the Variable balans, with rockers, which allow for constant movement and dynamic sitting. Though the chair tends to elicit a love-it-or-hate-it response, many people with back problems find it an indispensable aid, and this has proved a market niche.

The incisions between the armrest and the back weaken the shell, but would have been necessary if the shell was made from plywood. The polystyrene would have made a closed seating shell possible, but Jacobsen probably maintained the incision to create the Swan’s characteristic bird- or flower-like appearance. Since the start of production, the basic version of the Swan, which is still sold today, has been available with different variants of a cruciform base in either aluminium or laminated wood. In 1963 a base with a tilt function was added. The height-adjustable office chair with castors shown here was produced from 1958 until the 1970s.

The B 9 stool designed for the Bauhaus canteen was one of his first furniture designs made of tubular steel. Unlike Breuer’s B 3 lounge chair, better known as Wassily and designed at around the same time, the stool appears simple and unassuming. Breuer allowed himself to be guided by the malleability of tubular steel and conceived the stool as a continuous length of tube. The great chronicler of modernism Sigfried Giedion was thrilled: ‘The tubing flows in an endless line like Irish interlacement work.

Breuer allowed himself to be guided by the malleability of tubular steel and conceived the stool as a continuous length of tube.

But it was Panton who worked at it doggedly for many years until he at last had a viable product. How fitting, therefore, that the end result bearing his name has become such an icon of plastic furniture design.<br><br>Text: Mathias Remmele<br> | Around 60 years ago, plastic was a novel material. It has many advantages: it can be melted, poured, moulded into forms or processed into foam. Verner Panton sought to design a chair made from a single piece of plastic. The production of the chair proved very difficult. No company stepped forward to produce the chair until Panton encountered Vitra. After many years and tests, the Panton Chair was finally a reality.<br>","id":39590},{"_id":39636,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.449+0000"},"ObjId":39636,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:53.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0312","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"No. 306½","ObjDateFromInt":1904,"ObjDateToInt":1905,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1904/05","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"c. 1907–1915 The Craftsman Workshops, New York, New York, USA","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MUS-1082-1","ObjDateTxt":"1904/05","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Stained oak / leather covering","ObjDimension":"92,2 x 43 x 52,5 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"0312","ObjContentMaterial":"Wood","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"},{"ConId":100376235,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Wood"}],"ObjDesigner":"Gustav(e) Stickley","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":5689,"PerNameTxt":"The Craftsman Workshops","PerBirthPlaceCity":"New York","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"United States","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":69764,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/39636.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/39636.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/39636.jpg","ladimensions":[1000,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/39636.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/39636.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"‘Craftsman furniture’,<sup>1</sup> which Gustav Stickley and his four brothers sold through different companies and which included chair model No. 306½, shown here, are important examples of the United States Arts and Crafts movement.

Like a glove, the chair embraces the seated individual’s body, and contains a veiled erotic allusion to Marilyn Monroe, with whom Joe DiMaggio had a tempestuous love affair.<br><br>Text: Fulvio Ferrari<br>","id":40143},{"_id":40161,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.453+0000"},"ObjId":40161,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1533","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"DAX/Plastic Armchair, A-Shell, Fiberglass Chair","ObjDateFromInt":1948,"ObjDateToInt":1950,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1948–1950","ObjCategoryVoc":"Armchair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"1950–1989 Herman Miller Furniture Company, Zeeland, Michigan, USA (seit 1960 Herman Miller)","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MEA-1122-1","ObjDateTxt":"1948–1950","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Fibreglass-reinforced polyester / lacquered tubular steel / rubber / plastic","ObjDimension":"74,5 x 63 x 63 cm","ObjHighlight":"Highlights, Für Kinder","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"1533","ObjContentMaterial":"Plastic","ObjContentType":"Armchairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376259,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Armchairs"},{"ConId":100376236,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Plastic"},{"ConId":2,"ConTypeUnilang":"Für Kinder","ConType":"Für Kinder","ConTxt":"For Kids"}],"ObjDesigner":"Charles & Ray Eames","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":2967,"PerNameTxt":"Charles & Ray Eames","PerTypeVoc":"Designer","PerUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/ArtistModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/2967.jpg"},{"PerId":8033,"PerNameTxt":"Herman Miller Furniture Company","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Zeeland, Michigan","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"United States","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":73822,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40161.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40161.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/40161.jpg","ladimensions":[1500,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/40161.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40161.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"The concept of a one-piece ergonomic seat shell had already been formulated by Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen in 1940.

Saarinen further experimented with the idea of a moulded plastic shell armchair – Model 71 – and adapted an earlier upholstered wooden frame design by Florence Knoll which had been custom-made in 1945 for the Rockefeller family offices in Manhattan. The 70-Series catapulted Knoll to a leading position among design companies and established Eero Saarinen as a major protagonist of American post-war design.<br><br>Text: Anniina Koivu<br>","id":40492},{"_id":40494,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.457+0000"},"ObjId":40494,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-10-17T12:21:11.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Kolonial Fauteuil Mod. 28, Kolonialstuhl Mod. 28/Safari Chair","ObjDateFromInt":1928,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1928","ObjCategoryVoc":"Armchair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"Probably 1945 – unknown Wohnbedarf, Zürich, Schweiz","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"SCH-1012","ObjDateTxt":"1928","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Matted beech / leather (not original) / leather straps","ObjDimension":"89 x 56 x 57 cm","ObjContentMaterial":"Leather, Wood","ObjContentType":"Armchairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376259,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Armchairs"},{"ConId":100376237,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Leather"},{"ConId":100376235,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Wood"}],"ObjDesigner":"Wilhelm Kienzle","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":1762,"PerNameTxt":"Wilhelm Kienzle","PerDatingTxt":"1886–1958","PerTypeVoc":"Designer"},{"PerId":9877,"PerNameTxt":"Wohnbedarf","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Zurich","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Switzerland","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":68420,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40494.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40494.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/40494.jpg","ladimensions":[1310,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/40494.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40494.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"This dismountable chair was created by the Swiss designer Wilhelm Kienzle.

Its frame – it was designed to be ‘stacked horizontally’<sup>1</sup> – is made of folded, pressed sheet steel, flat tubing, and welded round tubing. The base and the sides of the backrest form a single unit, a pivot mechanism regulates the folding of the seat. The bar connecting the uprights has a dual function, as a stiffener and as a handle when moving the chair. The profile of the legs has been calculated to ensure absolute stability, whatever the sitter’s position. The backrest and seat are made from stretched and laced red canvas.<br><br>Prouvé’s ‘mechanical chairs’ indicate his resolve to provide strength and comfort via the use of folded and welded sheet steel and simple mechanical adjustments. It is this which characterizes Prouvé’s own aesthetics as opposed to many modernist designers who only worked with tubular steel.<br><br><sup>1</sup> ʻLa fabrication industrielle des meubles chez Jean Prouvéʼ, 1965.<br><br>Text: Catherine Coley<br>","id":41923},{"_id":41939,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.460+0000"},"ObjId":41939,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"0233","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled","ObjDateFromInt":1890,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"ca. 1890","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"c. 1890–1902 Carlo Bugatti, Mailand, Italien","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1203","ObjDateTxt":"c. 1890","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Lacquered wood / painted vellum / metal inlays / silk tassels","ObjDimension":"86,5 x 41 x 48 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"0233","ObjContentMaterial":"Wood","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"},{"ConId":100376235,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Wood"}],"ObjDesigner":"Carlo Bugatti","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":10779,"PerNameTxt":"Carlo Bugatti","PerDatingTxt":"1856–1940","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Milan","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Italy","PerTypeVoc":"Designer","PerUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/ArtistModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/10779.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":67812,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/41939.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/41939.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/41939.jpg","ladimensions":[1178,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/41939.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/41939.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"While in the late nineteenth century international exhibitions and trade fairs helped spread industrially produced furniture such as designs from the manufacturer Thonet, those same events also very much celebrated the luxurious, entirely hand-crafted objects from Carlo Bugatti’s Milan atelier.

It consists of a single, elegantly curved tubular line. Its dynamic appearance is emphasized by the backrest, which is bent in the same radius. The chair also came in a folding version. Unlike the cantilever chairs designed by Mart Stam and Mies van der Rohe, this model’s unusually slim plywood seat is not integrated visually into the line of tubing but rather sits on two consoles on the inside of the tubular steel construction. Thus the seat, slanted towards the back, appears to float. While the familiar cantilevered chairs of tubular steel were characterized by clear geometrical forms, Luckhardt went in a completely new direction.

It consists of a single, elegantly curved tubular line. Its dynamic appearance is emphasized by the backrest, which is bent in the same radius. The chair also came in a folding version. Unlike the cantilever chairs designed by Mart Stam and Mies van der Rohe, this model’s unusually slim plywood seat is not integrated visually into the line of tubing but rather sits on two consoles on the inside of the tubular steel construction. Thus the seat, slanted towards the back, appears to float. While the familiar cantilevered chairs of tubular steel were characterized by clear geometrical forms, Luckhardt went in a completely new direction. This design is related to the dynamic-organic forms of the Streamline Moderne style, which became increasingly popular in the 1920s in the United States and also influenced European architecture and design in the 1930s. Alfred Zeffner employed a similar form for his bar trolley in 1930.

The uninterrupted groove in the backrest and seat fulfils structural functions while also serving as a ventilation canal.<sup>1</sup> After two plaster models had been made to confirm the proportions and test the form, a prototype of fibreglass-reinforced polyester was laminated. The chair was exhibited at the International Furniture Fair Cologne in 1968.

It was to be both comfortable and do justice to the materials used, and should allow the sitter optimal freedom of movement by having only a few points of contact with the body. Beltzig sketched out a reduced, ergonomic form meeting these requirements. The chair has a narrow support for the neck and pelvis which develops into a seat offering compact support for the thighs. The uninterrupted groove in the backrest and seat fulfils structural functions while also serving as a ventilation canal.<sup>1</sup> After two plaster models had been made to confirm the proportions and test the form, a prototype of fibreglass-reinforced polyester was laminated. The chair was exhibited at the International Furniture Fair Cologne in 1968. Despite its positive reception, the complex manual production process meant that by 1976 only approximately fifty to sixty chairs had been produced by Beltzig’s firm.<sup>2</sup> The Munich-based gallery owner Wolfgang Mauer reissued a limited edition of the chair in 1992; all one hundred copies were numbered and signed by Beltzig.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Günter Beltzig’s preliminary studies for the Floris chair, Vitra Design Museum, Inv.

Looking back, the designer described his approach as a “mixture of naivety and bluntness”. Until that point in time, aluminium die-casting had mainly been used to produce bases for furnishings. Now it became Grcic’s aim to create an entire chair, or at least a major portion of it, in die-cast aluminium. The seat shell of Chair_One is constructed like a football, with a number of flat planes assembled at angles to create a three-dimensional structure. Grcic worked alternately with cardboard models and computer simulation to finally achieve this unusual and highly distinctive form.

Looking back, the designer described his approach as a “mixture of naivety and bluntness”. Until that point in time, aluminium die-casting had mainly been used to produce bases for furnishings. Now it became Grcic’s aim to create an entire chair, or at least a major portion of it, in die-cast aluminium. The seat shell of Chair_One is constructed like a football, with a number of flat planes assembled at angles to create a three-dimensional structure. Grcic worked alternately with cardboard models and computer simulation to finally achieve this unusual and highly distinctive form.

The wires are bent and welded manually using an assembly jig, the seat’s shell is bound together with the underframe using four shock mounts to restrict the swinging motion. Due to its lightness, elegance and the memorable sculptural impression it leaves, the Diamond Chair remains probably the best-known seating furniture designed out of wire.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Florence Knoll cited in Schiffer and Bertoia, *The World of Bertoia* (2003), 36.<br><br>Text: Mathias Remmele<br>","id":42032},{"_id":42050,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.469+0000"},"ObjId":42050,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-10-18T12:27:22.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled","ObjDateFromInt":1874,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1874","ObjCategoryVoc":"Rocking chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"1874 – unknown Henry I.

This meant that it was ideally suited to a wide range of applications and was especially useful for seating large numbers of people, such as in factories, auditoriums, sidewalk cafés, and parks in French spa towns. In 1925, the Frenchman Xavier Pauchard developed his own variant of the chair, Chair A, which differs from Mathieu’s model both in terms of the shape of the seat and the legs. In addition to defining a new style of metal furniture, Mathieu’s model anticipated many characteristics of the Monobloc, the stacking chair made of a single piece of plastic, which has been the world’s most widely used outdoor chair since the 1970s.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Billé, ‘French Industrial Metallic Furniture’ (2007), 140.<br><br>Text: Henrike Büscher / Peter Dunas<br>","id":42119},{"_id":42169,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.471+0000"},"ObjId":42169,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1934","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled/Fauteuil bas empilable","ObjDateFromInt":1953,"ObjDateToInt":1954,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1953/54","ObjCategoryVoc":"Lounge chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"1953/54 Ateliers Miyoshi, Tokio, Japan","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MFR-1053-2","ObjDateTxt":"1953/54","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Solid wood / cushions with fabric covering","ObjDimension":"55,5 x 46 x 76 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"1934","ObjContentMaterial":"Wood","ObjContentType":"Lounge chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376264,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Lounge chairs"},{"ConId":100376235,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Wood"}],"ObjDesigner":"Charlotte Perriand","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":4444,"PerNameTxt":"Charlotte Perriand","PerDatingTxt":"1903–1999","PerTypeVoc":"Designer","PerUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/ArtistModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/4444.jpg"}],"ObjObjectRel":[{"ObjId":29182,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1931","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MFR-1029","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled/Chaise empilable Ombre","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1954","ObjDesigner":"Charlotte Perriand","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/29182.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":67915,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/42169.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/42169.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/42169.jpg","ladimensions":[1500,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/42169.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/42169.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"Charlotte Perriand visited Japan in 1953 and stayed for nearly two years.

Chair shown here are connected by a triangular seat frame directly underneath the seat; the bent rear leg ends in the paddle-like backrest. Bill created both the more expansive version with conical legs shown here and a variant with cup-shaped feet, which never went into production. The seat and backrest of the Tripod Chair are made of slightly bent plywood. That two boards of the seat frame met the rear leg – and with it the main load-bearing part of the chair – at an angle of 60 degrees turned out to be a structural weakness.

This shows that Herbst was less interested in the constructive advantages of bendable tubular steel than in the ultimate form and the reflective surface of the metal, even though welding was done by hand and drove up production costs. This is a typical feature of French tubular-steel furniture from that period.<br><br>We can assume that the number of No. 212 chairs produced was fairly low.

In the 1940s, this type of fastener was found primarily in boats, automobiles, and airplanes. The dynamic form of the chair, not least its backrest evocative of a propeller or wing, is also evidence of Thaden’s background in aeroplane design.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Vegesack, *Airworld* (2004).<br><br>Mathias Schwartz-Clauss / Gerald W.

That same year the Castiglionis designed another version of this unique piece of furniture, this time moulded from a 1935 tractor seat; the seat itself was made from sheet metal and the piece featured a stainless-steel bow and a wooden crosspiece. This model was part of a living-room ensemble which they designed for the exhibition *Colori e forme nella casa d’oggi* at the Villa Olmo in Como.<sup>1</sup> They also showed another prototype of a stool consisting of a bicycle saddle affixed to a metal bar. Both stool designs follow the same principle of removing serially produced components from their original context as *objets trouvés* and combining them to form a new article for everyday use. Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni wrote design history with this technique, thus laying the foundations for a more fundamental rethinking of design that would take place a decade later with the emergence of Radical Design.<br><br>In the late 1960s, Zanotta began producing several Radical Design models and in 1970 the company also took up production of the tractor seat stool. It was adapted to serial production and given the name Mezzadro (sharecropper) as an allusion to its original agricultural context.<sup>2</sup><br><br><sup>1</sup> Casciani, *Furniture as Architecture* (1988), 56.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Ibid.<br><br>Text: Julia Selzer<br>","id":40695},{"_id":40725,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.478+0000"},"ObjId":40725,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1932","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Nagasaki","ObjDateFromInt":1954,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1954","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"1954–1959 Société Matégot, Paris, Frankreich","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MFR-1004-2","ObjDateTxt":"1954","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Lacquered tubular steel / lacquered perforated sheet steel / rubber feet","ObjDimension":"74,6 x 57,4 x 58 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"1932","ObjContentMaterial":"Metal","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"},{"ConId":100376238,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Metal"}],"ObjDesigner":"Mathieu Matégot","ObjObjectRel":[{"ObjId":40751,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1411","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MEA-1064-2","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"DCM1","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1945","ObjDesigner":"Charles & Ray Eames","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40751.jpg"},{"ObjId":42238,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"1414","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MCH-1012","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Untitled/Tripod Chair","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1949","ObjDesigner":"Max Bill","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/42238.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":71451,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40725.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40725.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/40725.jpg","ladimensions":[1500,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/40725.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40725.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"Mathieu Matégot was one of the first furniture designers to use perforated sheet steel.

Another version of the model has a higher base, with the steel strips bent nearly in the form of circular segments.<sup>2</sup> Both models were initially produced by Mobilier International in Paris.<sup>3</sup> In the late 1970s, production was taken over by Tendo Brasileira in São Paulo, Brazil, but with the base structure now made of plywood.<sup>4</sup> Parallels to Niemeyer’s built works are obvious; just as his buildings, the lounge chair betrays his preference for organic curves and combines classic modernism’s rigour with the freer aesthetic and sophisticated style of post-war Latin-American architecture.<br><br><sup>1</sup> ‘Siège du Parti Communiste Français’ (1974), 100–03.<br><br><sup>2</sup> http://opac.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/fiche/fauteuil-on1.<br><br><sup>3</sup> Hanks, ed., *The Century of Modern Design* (2010), 275.<br><br><sup>4</sup> Emery, *Furniture by Architects* (1983), 220, 224.<br><br>Text: Henrike Büscher<br>","id":40898},{"_id":40926,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.481+0000"},"ObjId":40926,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-05-17T13:40:54.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO+SD","ObjObjectNumberTxt":"2811","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Plia","ObjDateFromInt":1967,"ObjDateToInt":1969,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1967–1969","ObjCategoryVoc":"Folding chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"Since 1969 Anonima Castelli, Bologna, Italien (seit 1993 Teil von Haworth, Holland, Michigan, USA)","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1052-2","ObjDateTxt":"c. 1969—1980","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Chrome-plated tubular steel / die-cast aluminium / cellulose acetate butyrate (Cellidor)","ObjDimension":"75 x 47 x 49,5 cm","ObjCurrentLocationVrt":"2811","ObjContentFunction":"Foldable","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376207,"ConTypeUnilang":"Funktion","ConType":"Function","ConTxt":"Foldable"},{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"}],"ObjDesigner":"Giancarlo Piretti","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":3217,"PerNameTxt":"Giancarlo Piretti","PerDatingTxt":"1943","PerTypeVoc":"Designer"},{"PerId":5078,"PerNameTxt":"Castelli","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Bologna","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Italy","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent"}],"ObjObjectRel":[{"ObjId":40116,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"3334","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"MIT-1363","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Piana","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"2010","ObjDesigner":"David Chipperfield","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40116.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":73337,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40926.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/40926.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/40926.jpg","ladimensions":[1290,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/40926.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/40926.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"The Plia folding chair is the best-known work of the Italian designer Giancarlo Piretti.

The Tulip Chair, which went into production in 1958, soon became a widely published design icon, anticipating the futuristic look of many interiors in the 1960s.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Saarinen, *Eero Saarinen on His Work* (1962), 66.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Ibid.<br><br>Text: Anniina Koivu<br>","id":41133},{"_id":41154,"SyncDate":{"$date":"2018-11-16T17:31:26.484+0000"},"ObjId":41154,"ObjMutationDate":{"$date":"2018-10-17T09:22:22.000+0000"},"ObjDomain":"SO","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Myto","ObjDateFromInt":2008,"ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"2008","ObjCategoryVoc":"Chair","ObjDateGrp_Notes2Clb":"Since 2008 Plank, Auer, Italien","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"SGE-1012","ObjDateTxt":"2008","ObjMaterialTechniqueTxt":"Plastic (Ultradur High Speed)","ObjDimension":"81 x 51 x 52,5 cm","ObjContentMaterial":"Plastic","ObjContentType":"Chairs","ObjContentRel":[{"ConId":100376236,"ConTypeUnilang":"Material","ConType":"Material","ConTxt":"Plastic"},{"ConId":100376267,"ConTypeUnilang":"Typ","ConType":"Type","ConTxt":"Chairs"}],"ObjDesigner":"Konstantin Grcic","ObjPersonRel":[{"PerId":8285,"PerNameTxt":"Plank","PerBirthPlaceCity":"Auer","PerBirthPlaceCountry":"Italy","PerTypeVoc":"Produzent"}],"ObjObjectRel":[{"ObjId":44645,"ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"SGE-1029","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"341/5, Chassis","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"2006–2008","ObjDesigner":"Stefan Diez","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/44645.jpg"},{"ObjId":42887,"ObjObjectNumberTxt":"3243","ObjObjectNumberGrp_Part1Txt":"SGE-1027-1","ObjObjectTitleTxt":"Chair_One","ObjDateGrp_DateFromTxt":"1999—2004","ObjDesigner":"Konstantin Grcic","ObjUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/42887.jpg"}],"ObjMultimediaRel":[{"MulId":73511,"MulDefinition":"imageStandard","MulUrl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/41154.jpg","MulUrls":[{"xl":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/superImageResolution/41154.jpg","la":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/highImageResolution/41154.jpg","ladimensions":[1198,1500],"me":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/mediumImageResolution/41154.jpg","sm":"https://vitra.zetcom.com/Vitra/Images/CollectionModuleStandardImages/lowImageResolution/41154.jpg"}]}],"ObjMarkdown":"In collaboration with BASF and the South Tyrolean furniture manufacturer Plank, Konstantin Grcic developed the stackable cantilever chair Myto.

Heinz Rasch applied for a patent for the subsequent model, a tubular steel model with plywood seat and back, in 1928, and was granted it in 1932.<sup>2</sup> In 1932 Heinz Rasch was in correspondence with Vereinigte Leichtmetallwerke in Bonn and two French firms regarding a lightweight metal design of the folding chair, but there is no evidence of the project ever having been implemented.<sup>3</sup><br><br><sup>1</sup> Rasch, Bodo and Rasch, Heinz, *Der Stuhl* (Stuttgart: Akademischer Verlag Dr. Fritz Wedekind & Co., 1928) 36–41.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Rasch, Heinz, Deutsches Reichspatent (DPR) 551.625, filed 01.08.1928, issued 12.05.1932.<br><br><sup>3</sup> Letter to Vereinigte Leichtmetallwerke, Bonn, 14.05.1932 and letter to the company KAP, Puteaux, 22.08.1932, Vitra Design Museum.<br><br>Text: Barbara M.
